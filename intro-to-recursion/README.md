# Recursion and Fibonacci

### Setting intent

Now that we've had guidance on setting intent, what would you like the intent for today's class to be?

Discuss as a class, and keep this in mind throughout your day.

## Trivia Questions

- What is the difference between `1000` and `1_000`?
- What does `parseInt()` do?
- What does `parseFloat()` do?
- What does `Number()` do?
- What does `isNaN()` do?

## Fibonacci Sequence

Write a function that prints numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit

- `fibonacci(5)`
- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
- `fibonacci(23)`
- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
